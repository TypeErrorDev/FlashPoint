## Functionality that works

- As of right now, I have had to hard code the Flashcards and their Decks. Will modify that in the future
- You can go through the flashcards and will either get a Correct/Incorrect response, and either gain points or not if the answer is right/wrong
- When you finish the deck, the score summary will calculate the points/percentage of correct answers
- Your decks card count and total possible points are calculated properly
- You can signout properly
- Working endpoints
  - `/` (ðŸ”“) This is the login page
  - `/dashboard` (ðŸ”’) This is the dashboard with the decks displayed
  - `/deck/create` (ðŸ”’) Deck creation (Not implemented yet)
  - `/deck/:deckId/:deckName` (ðŸ”’) View the deck
  - `/settings` (ðŸ”’) View the Settings page. Needs more work, kinda useless right now

## Functionality that breaks

- Refreshing the page returns you to the login screen.
- Cannot create new decks/flashcards at the moment
- Settings page is pretty much useless
- Cannot create/edit/delete decks yet
